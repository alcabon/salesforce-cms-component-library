This Salesforce DX (SFDX) repoistory contains a collection of extended CMS components for use with Salesforce Experience Cloud.

# Prereqs

In order to use this app, you'll need to ensure that you have...

* A Salesforce dev org
* Knowledge of SFDX
* Some JavaScript skills

# Setup

## Deploy

Use SFDX, once connected to your Dev org's Dev Hub to deploy the source. The packaged LWCs are built entirely with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS powered by the static resources included in the repo. The paired Apex classes will be deployed alongside these LWC.

# Etc.
